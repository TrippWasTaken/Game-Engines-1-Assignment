The ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣ Visualizer

I plan to create a Music Visualizer around the theme of Vaporwave and lofi music such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xw3S7FHPro) or the more classic [Home-Resonance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GW6sLrK40k) and [MACINTOSH PLUS - リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュー |](https://youtu.be/aQkPcPqTq4M)

 The goal is to create a procedual car ride that will take you through the visual style of vaporwave asthetic type videos to truly maximize the feeling of endlessness and nostalgia that these songs tend to have.
 
 
 Think these images but we continually move towards the sunset never quite getting there as the surroundings in our visual react to the music

As the song reaches closer to its end so does our sunset as the seemingly endless car ride ends and fades with the song
